            <br />The Indian Railways is taking a huge step towards the preservation of water. On March 22, the day globally marked as World Water Day, railways will be rolling out a new policy that is likely to be a game-changer. The railways will buy recycled water from private players. This is to not only ensure water is not unnecessarily wasted, but also to cut down on the annual water bill of the Indian Railways by 7400 crore. The treated and recycled water will be extensively used for various purposes except for drinking.

This policy would not simply be implemented in railway stations and in trains but also all railway zones such as hospitals, factories, colonies etc. Up until now, the railways has been buying water from the state.

This move is also to ensure that unnecessary amount of money does not get spent in the process. A senior Railway Ministry official spoke to the Economic Times and elaborated on the policy framework that is being put in place. The official noted, “The water policy envisages buying treated water from water treatment plants for 2 paise per litre, while we now purchase water for 7 paise per litre.” IIT-B Professors helped the Railways to design timetables in less than 5 Minutes.&nbsp;

Currently the government spends a whopping 4,000 crore on its water bill alone on a yearly basis. The railways will encourage private players to set up water treatment plants specifically for this purpose and authorities will also ensure that treated water is bought from these plants alone.

According to the official, the new water policy will also be promoting a better water management system that will curtail water wastage and consumption.

            <br />According to Indian Railways, the entertainment content on demand services will be provided on the personal devices of passengers in all trains and stations in a phased manner, which will be listed out in the Tender Document.

The licensee/service provider will be allowed to provide streaming Audio and video content services on all trains, however, radio service will not be allowed at stations. This makes sense because Radio is omnipresent, and sometimes gets a little messed up during the journey.

Indian Railways will hand over digital physical brochures to apprise the passengers about this technology, while also announce the same during the journey. Passengers can use the WiFi services and get CoD on their smartphones or laptops, which will make the journey less boring and more engaging.

The content providers will offer both paid and unpaid content, so customers can choose to view any type of content they want. This will also generate more views and revenue for these service providers. The service provider shall provide only ‘U’, ‘U/A’, ‘PG’ rated video content and ‘A’ rated content shall not be permitted.

In the end, the Government will also be taking some share of this from content providers, but everyone knows how train journeys can be boring, and this is an excellent initiative to generate more content and keep the passengers feeling more satisfied.

            <br />Railways currently has to forgo about Rs 20 crore every day and Rs 7,300 crore annually on refunds for unconfirmed tickets.

Good news is in store for the Indian Railways. Reeling under massive financial losses, estimated to be at Rs 40,000 crore, the railways might be able to recover an estimated Rs 20 crore every day with its Vikalp scheme, which was launched nationwide on Wednesday.

Under this scheme, wait-listed passengers will be able to travel in other trains on the same routes. The aim of the scheme is to utilise vacant berths in premier trains. Sources told DNA that the railways currently has to forgo about Rs 20 crore every day and Rs 7,300 crore annually on refunds for unconfirmed tickets.

Under the Vikalp scheme, passengers will be able to travel in premium trains such as Rajdhani and Shatabdi at regular fares, even if they book tickets in other mail or express trains for the same destinations, a spokesperson for the Indian Railways said on Wednesday. This will happen if there is availability in premium trains but no seats in express trains.

Wait-listed passengers can get confirmed accommodation in the next train if they opt for Vikalp while booking tickets online. The facility would, of course, be available for the same-class tickets across different trains – meaning if you book a ticket in three-tier AC coach, you would get an alternative accommodation in a different train in the same class.

Financially, it is a win-win situation for railways. Under Vikalp, the promise of an alternative arrangement will ensure passengers might not cancel and seek a refund, even if the chances of their wait-listed tickets getting confirmed — in the normal course of things — are slim.

The catch in this scheme is that if a passenger does not like the alternative train, he can cancel the ticket but it would be treated as cancellation of a fully confirmed ticket.

For instance, if one books a ticket in Rajdhani while choosing Vikalp but fails to get a confirmed ticket, one can end up getting a confirmed ticket of an express train. However, if the passenger cancels the ticket, he/she won't get any refund.

Vikalp may also pave the way for the introduction of more special trains, sources said. They added that the number of Vikalp seekers on different routes will give railways a realistic idea of the demand for special rates on different routes. Special trains are run by railways on some routes to meet the additional rush during festival/examination season. These trains generate approximately Rs 200 crore.

The railways have been running the scheme on six routes, including Delhi-Lucknow, Delhi-Jammu and Delhi-Mumbai sectors since November 1 on a pilot basis. From April 1, the scheme would be available on routes across the country. The system is available for online ticketing now, but it will soon be extended to over-the-counter sale also as the software is being readied for that purpose.
